  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a results-driven cybersecurity engineer with 5+ years of experience spanning enterprise, consulting, and financial sectors. 
    Currently supporting SIEM operations at JP Morgan Chase, I specialize in log ingestion, threat detection, and incident response across thousands of endpoints. 
    My expertise includes Microsoft Sentinel, Defender XDR, Splunk, CrowdStrike Falcon, and IBM QRadar, with a proven track record in reducing incident response times, 
    eliminating false positives, and strengthening security postures in cloud and on-prem environments. 
    Passionate about security automation, mentoring teams, and driving compliance with industry frameworks such as NIST, ISO, and SOC 2.

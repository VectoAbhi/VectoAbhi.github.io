        <p class="text-gray-300 text-justify">
          At JP Morgan Chase, I lead efforts to enhance security monitoring and incident response for over 20 critical banking applications. By streamlining log ingestion and event correlation using Microsoft Sentinel and Splunk, I have significantly accelerated threat detection in heavily regulated environments. My work on vulnerability assessments and remediation coordination has fortified endpoint defenses, reducing risks to critical finance systems. I also design and execute phishing simulations grounded in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, resulting in measurable improvements in employee threat recognition. Additionally, I manage identity governance through robust Azure AD access controls and have spearheaded compliance reviews aligned with SOC 2, NIST, and FFIEC standards.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-justify">
          At KPMG, I delivered advanced threat detection enhancements by investigating complex alerts across multiple platforms including Sentinel, Splunk, and CrowdStrike. My efforts in refining detection logic helped eliminate noise and sharpen focus on genuine threats. I led proactive threat hunts mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, successfully identifying sophisticated lateral movements. I also developed custom detection rules in KQL to catch phishing attempts and credential misuse. A key achievement was deploying Microsoft Defender across hybrid infrastructure and configuring Conditional Access policies in Azure AD to secure user access. I designed executive security dashboards to visualize incident trends and containment metrics, empowering leadership to make informed decisions while ensuring vulnerability management processes cleared over 95% of critical risks.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-justify">
          During my tenure at Tata Consultancy Services, I transformed alert triaging and detection workflows by automating KQL queries in Microsoft Sentinel, shortening response times significantly. I optimized IDS/IPS operations by tuning alert parameters and reducing false positives, enabling security analysts to focus on high-value threats. I engineered log onboarding pipelines from diverse telemetry sources, enhancing event correlation and situational awareness. Managing security controls for a massive endpoint fleet, I deployed automated playbooks easing manual workloads. My forensic analyses curbed persistent malware outbreaks and I implemented layered Microsoft 365 threat protections to reduce email risks. I led extensive audit cycles mapped to major frameworks, driving remediation efforts and fortifying control environments. A proud achievement includes guiding junior analysts through hands-on training, which substantially cut false escalations.

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-justify">
          Starting my security career at Dell Technologies, I honed my skills in triaging complex phishing, malware, and DDoS alerts using industry-leading SIEM tools. I utilized Wireshark to detect and report unauthorized access attempts, contributing to network defense. Partnering with Tier 2 analysts, I refined firewall and IDS/IPS configurations to diminish false positives and elevate detection accuracy. I regularly simulated phishing attacks to gauge employee susceptibility and tracked improvements. Monitoring hundreds of endpoints with Defender XDR, I ensured rapid threat escalation and compliance documentation. I contributed to successful pre-audit preparations by managing ISO 27001 technical controls and performed vulnerability scans that led to prioritized remediation.
